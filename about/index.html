    <p>I am a final-year PhD student at <a href="https://ai.stanford.edu/"><strong>Stanford</strong></a>, advised by <a href="https://ai.stanford.edu/~cbfinn/"><strong>Chelsea Finn</strong></a>. I am interested in building autonomous decision making agents that can make our life simpler in both digital and physical worlds. To that end, I have worked on <strong>reinforcement learning</strong> methods for <strong>aligning large language models with human preferences</strong> and improving <strong>autonomous decision making of physical robots</strong>. I am excited to build a future where we imbibe these agents with greater reasoning and planning capabilities.</p>

<p>Previously, I was an AI resident at <a href="https://ai.google/research/teams/brain"><strong>Google Brain</strong></a>. I graduated from <a href="http://www.iitk.ac.in/"><strong>IIT Kanpur</strong></a> with a Bachelors in <a href="http://www.iitk.ac.in/ee/"><strong>Electrical Engineering</strong></a> and minors in Machine Learning and Linguistic Theory. At IIT Kanpur, I worked with <a href="https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/piyush/"><strong>Dr. Piyush Rai</strong></a>. As a research intern at <a href="https://mila.umontreal.ca/"><strong>Montreal Institute of Learning Algorithms (MILA)</strong></a>, I worked with <a href="http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~bengioy/yoshua_en/"><strong>Dr. Yoshua Bengio</strong></a>.</p>

<!-- I hail from the holy city of [**Amritsar, Punjab**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amritsar). Just like many other math oriented students in India, I decided to give [**JEE**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Entrance_Examination) in 2014. I did decently well, securing AIR 376 after two years of toil, which landed me in Electrical Engineering at IIT Kanpur. --> 

<!-- _Why Electrical @ IIT Kanpur?_ That constitutes a separate discussion. It suffices to say though that Electrical Engineering has been more than gratifying for me as an undergraduate. -->

<!-- I maintain a secondary interest in Competitive Programming. I qualified for [**ACM ICPC India Regionals 2016**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACM_International_Collegiate_Programming_Contest) in Amritapuri and Chennai, securing 63 rank in the online qualification round. -->

<!-- I fiddle with the guitar from time to time, which is a part of a general interest in music. I am always free to have a conversation or take/give recommendations for progressive and metal music. I was also, sometime in 21st century, fairly regular with Lawn Tennis. -->

<!-- In Summer of 2016, I got to intern in [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu/), supervised by [Dr. Srinivas Shakkottai](http://cesg.tamu.edu/faculty/sshakkot/). We worked on analyzing the privacy of a user in a DSRC environment, which enables vehicle to vehicle/infrastructure communication, using a combination of analytical and machine learning tools. -->
